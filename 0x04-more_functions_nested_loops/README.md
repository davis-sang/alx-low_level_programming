# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Mandatory Tasks

1. `Task 0 :` - function that checks for the uppercase character.
2. `Task 1 :` - function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
3. `Task 2 :` - function that multiplies two integers.
4. `Task 3 :` - function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
5. `Task 4 :` - function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    * Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`
    * Do not print `2` and `4`
    * You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.
   
6. `Task 5 :` - function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
7. `Task 6 :` - function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. `Task 7 :` - function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
9. `Task 8 :` - function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
10.`Task 9 :` - program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
11. `Task 10 :` - function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

## Advanced Tasks.

12. `Task 11 :` - program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.
13. `Task 12 :` - function that prints an integer. Prototype: `void print_number(int n);`
  ***requirements***
  
    * You can only use `_putchar` function to print.
    * You are not allowed to use long.
    * You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers.
    * You are not allowed to hard-code special values.
