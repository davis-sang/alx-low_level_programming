# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Mandatory Tasks
1. `Task 0 :` - program that prints `_putchar` followed by a new line.
2. `Task 1 :` - function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. 
3. `Task 2 :` - function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. `Task 3 :` - function that checks for lowercase character.
5. `Task 4 :` - function that checks for alphabetic character.
6. `Task 5 :` - function that prints the sign of a number.
7. `Task 6 :` - function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. `Task 7 :` - function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. `Task 8 :` - function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
10. `Task 9 :` -  function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
11. `Task 10 :` - function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. `Task 11 :` - function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

## Advanced Tasks

13. `Task 12 :` - function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0.
14. `Task 13 :` - program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.
15. `Task 14 :` - program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
16. `Task 15 :` - program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
17. `Task 16 :` - program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
