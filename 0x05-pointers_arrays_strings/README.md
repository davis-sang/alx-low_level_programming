## Mandatory Tasks.

1. `Task 0 :` - a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
2. `Task 1 :` - function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. `Task 2 :` - function that returns the length of a string.
4. `Task 3 :` - function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
