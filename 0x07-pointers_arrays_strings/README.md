# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Mandatory Tasks

1. `Task 0 :` - function that fills memory with a constant byte . Implementation of `memset`.
2. `Task 1 :` - function that copies memory area. Implementation of `memcpy`.
3. `Task 2 :` - function that locates a character in a string. Implementation of `strstr`.
4. `Task 3 :` - function that gets the length of a prefix substring. Implementation of `strspn`.
5. `Task 4 :` - function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. Implementation of `strpbrk`.
6. `Task 5 :` - funtion that locates a substring. Implementation of `man strstr`.
7. `Task 6 :` - function that prints the chessboard.
8. `Task 7 :` - function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## Advanced Tasks

9. `Task 8 :` - function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
10. `Task 9 :` - file that contains the password for the [crackme2]() executable. Neat reverse engineering task.
